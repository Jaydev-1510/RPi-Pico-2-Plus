# RPi-Pico-2-Plus
Pico 2+ is a compact, custom PCB built around the RP2350B microcontroller, designed to break out all GPIO pins for maximum flexibility. It keeps the familiar Raspberry Pi Pico form factor but adds a more developer-friendly layout — giving access to every feature of the RP2350B including dual cores, PIO, ADC, and full-speed USB-C.
