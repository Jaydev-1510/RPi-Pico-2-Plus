## 11/3/2025 - Speed Ran the schematic  

Today I completed the schematic for the board. I had to chose C0201 parts because the routing will be dense as there will many GPIOs. Therefore, I chose not to get the grant because it will be very costly to assemble the PCB. Also, I had to chose the default 2MB flash on RPi Pico 2 because it has a small footprint. After asking chatGPT, I finally chose a good 3v3 voltage regulator with a small footprint. This is the schematic prepared so far-

## 11/4/2025 6 PM - Added LEDs  

I reviewed the schematic and added indication LEDs. I feel that I could now move on to the routing part. This journal was supposed to be posted yesterday night but I didn't.

## 11/4/2025 7 PM - Routed the PCB  

Yeah! Finally routing done. It was dense routing near the GPIOs, I had to choose 0.17mm tracks for this. Nvm, I have finally completed the PCB. And just now I remembered that I forgot SWD header. So, that will be the work for tomorrow along with the silkscreen.
